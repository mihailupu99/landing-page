              The MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam (aka ZZ Gundam, ZZ; pronounced "Double
              Zeta") is the titular mobile suit of the anime Mobile Suit Gundam
              ZZ and is piloted by Judau Ashta. A direct development of the
              MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, the ΖΖ Gundam, which had been completed
              through a prototype, was given the development code "θ" (thus also
              known as the "θ Gundam") as it was the sixth "Anaheim Gundam"
              after the RMS-099 Rick Dias (also known as “γ Gundam”).

            If people go into space, open their hearts, and develop their
            previously unawakened abilities, they will be able to continue
            developing and propagating forever. Space is infinite. I'd like you
            to consider the meaning of that infinity…
