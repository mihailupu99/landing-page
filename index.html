              The MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam (aka ZZ Gundam, ZZ; pronounced "Double
              Zeta") is the titular mobile suit of the anime Mobile Suit Gundam
              ZZ and is piloted by Judau Ashta. A direct development of the
              MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, the ΖΖ Gundam, which had been completed
              through a prototype, was given the development code "θ" (thus also
              known as the "θ Gundam") as it was the sixth "Anaheim Gundam"
              after the RMS-099 Rick Dias (also known as “γ Gundam”).
